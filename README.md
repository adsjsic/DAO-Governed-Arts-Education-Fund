# üéì DAO-Governed Arts Education Fund

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 platform that addresses the real-world problem of underfunded arts education in schools! Traditional funding for arts programs often lacks transparency, community involvement, and efficiency, leading to unequal access and bureaucratic delays. This project creates a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the Stacks blockchain to pool, govern, and distribute funds for arts education initiatives in schools worldwide. Donors contribute crypto, members propose and vote on grants, and funds are disbursed transparently‚Äîempowering communities to support creativity in education.

## ‚ú® Features

üîÑ Community-driven governance via DAO proposals and voting  
üí∞ Secure treasury for holding and managing donated funds  
üìù Grant application system for schools and educators  
‚úÖ Transparent review and approval process for proposals  
üé® NFT rewards for donors to incentivize contributions  
üìä On-chain tracking of fund usage and impact reports  
üö´ Anti-collusion mechanisms to ensure fair voting  
üåç Integration with oracles for real-world verification (e.g., school eligibility)  

## üõ† How It Works

This project leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts for secure, auditable operations. It involves 8 smart contracts to handle various aspects of the DAO and fund management, ensuring decentralization and trustlessness.

### Core Smart Contracts
1. **Governance Token (gov-token.clar)**: Manages the DAO's native token (e.g., ART-EDU). Handles minting, burning, and transfers. Tokens are distributed to donors based on contributions.
2. **Membership (membership.clar)**: Tracks DAO members. Requires holding a minimum number of governance tokens to join. Includes functions for registration, verification, and expulsion.
3. **Treasury (treasury.clar)**: Securely holds funds (STX or SIP-10 tokens). Supports deposits from donors and controlled withdrawals only via approved proposals.
4. **Proposal (proposal.clar)**: Allows members to submit grant proposals for arts education projects (e.g., supplying art materials to a school). Stores details like description, budget, and timeline.
5. **Voting (voting.clar)**: Enables token-weighted voting on proposals. Includes time-bound voting periods, quorum checks, and result tallying to prevent low-participation approvals.
6. **Grant Review (grant-review.clar)**: Facilitates a review stage where members can submit feedback or evidence. Uses simple scoring to flag high-quality applications.
7. **Fund Distribution (fund-distribution.clar)**: Automates the release of funds to approved grantees upon proposal success. Includes milestone-based payouts for accountability.
8. **Oracle Integration (oracle.clar)**: Connects to external oracles (e.g., via Stacks' Clarity extensions) to verify real-world data, like confirming a school's non-profit status or project completion.

**For Donors**  
- Contribute STX or tokens to the treasury contract.  
- Receive governance tokens and an optional NFT as a badge of support.  
- Call `donate` function in the treasury contract with your amount.  

Boom! You're now a DAO member helping fund arts education.

**For Proposers (Schools/Educators)**  
- Join the DAO if not already a member (via membership contract).  
- Submit a proposal with details using the proposal contract.  
- Gather community support during the review and voting phases.  

**For Voters (DAO Members)**  
- Review proposals via `get-proposal-details`.  
- Vote using the voting contract‚Äîyour token balance determines weight.  
- Track outcomes and fund releases on-chain.  

**For Verifiers/Auditors**  
- Use `get-fund-usage` in the fund-distribution contract to see transparent reports.  
- Verify via oracle data for real-world impact.  

This setup solves funding gaps in arts education by decentralizing decision-making, reducing corruption, and ensuring funds reach deserving programs. Deploy on Stacks for Bitcoin-secured transactions!
